You have been given an integer ‘N’. You are supposed to find if the given integer ‘N’ is a perfect square or not. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= N <= 10^18

Time limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
2
4
7    
Sample output 1:
Yes
No
Explanation of Sample Output 1:
In test case 1, since (2 * 2 == 4) so print “Yes”.

In test case 2, 7 is not a perfect square so print “No”.
Sample Input 2:
2
15
121
Sample output 2:
No
Yes
Explanation of Sample Output 2:
In test case 1, 15 is not a perfect square so print “No”.

In test case 2, since (11 * 11 == 121) so print “Yes”.

bool isPerfectSquare(long long n) {
	if(n>0){
		int x = sqrt(n);
		return x*x == n;
	}
}
