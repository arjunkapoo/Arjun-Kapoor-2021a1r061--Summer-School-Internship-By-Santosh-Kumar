Problem statement
You are given a Singly Linked List of integers and an integer 'K'. Your task is to remove all such nodes from the linked list whose value is equal to 'K'.

A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which we can traverse only in one direction i.e., from Head to Tail. It consists of several nodes where each node contains some data and a reference to the next node.

A sample Linked List-


Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= node.data <= 10^9 and node.data != -1 
0 <= K <= 10^9

Where 'node.data' denotes the value of a Linked list node, and 'K' denotes the value of the nodes to be removed.

Time limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
2
2 5 7 10 -1
7
4 9 10 -1
3
Sample Output 1:
2 5 10 -1
4 9 10 -1
Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
For the first test case, the given Linked List is

So, after deleting the node with value 7, the Linked List becomes 

For the second test case, the given Linked List is

As no node in the Linked List has value 3,  the Linked List remains unchanged.
Sample Input 2:
2
4 9 4 -1
4
1 2 -1
6
Sample Output 2:
9 -1
1 2 -1
Explanation Of Sample Input 2:
For the first test case, the given Linked List is [4, 9, 4]. So, after deleting both the node with value 4, the Linked List becomes [9].

For the second test case, the given Linked List is [1, 2]. As no node in the Linked List has value 6,  the Linked List remains unchanged.

Coding :

Node *removeNodes(Node *head, int k) {
     if(head==NULL)
        return NULL;
    while(head != NULL && head->data==k)
        head=head->next;
    Node* curr=head;
    Node* prev=NULL;
    while(curr){
        if(curr->data==k){
            prev->next=curr->next;
        }
        else{
            prev=curr;
        }
        curr=curr->next;
    }
    return head;
}
